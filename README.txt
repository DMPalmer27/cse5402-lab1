1. Modules

I set up the module structure by creating a core subdirectory titled "lab1" that holds all of the program's functionality other than environment-related tasks such as command line arguments. Within this subdirectory, I created two files, one that contains types, constants, and static variables used across the entire program and another that contains the core routine for generating the script.
